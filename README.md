# Express App Boilerplate

![The definition of "boilerplate"](https://i.imgur.com/0xEmAP6.png)

This is a template repository used to simplify the above, as setting this up for every project adds up overtime.

## Usage

```sh
yarn create next-app -e https://github.com/cyrus01337/next-app-boilerplate .
```

`.` is the current directory, meaning the project will be generated in the directory this command is invoked under, whereas omitting the `.` (path) creates a sub-directory and goes through the typical interactive installation.

## Author's Notes

This is not a stack that is expected to be used by many developers, but it is one that provides enough dependencies to cover most use cases that may warrant Express to be used as the back-end framework of choice. React to me will be my front-end framework of choice and due to this I have not included a layer/easy method, other than changing the Webpack configurations manually, to support other front-end frameworks - this is not a framework in itself but a template and will never evolve to become such a thing, although similar projects like [Astro](https://astro.build/) or [my NextJS boilerplate project](https://github.com/cyrus01337/next-app-boilerplate) may catch your eye if this back-end's structure appears bloated (it is).

I include many tools that I typically use in projects, leading to this project being extremely specific and opinionated and as such if you enjoy this "stack" but would like to change specific parts you are welcome to create your own fork.

The project also runs the Webpack development server (`webpack-dev-server`) and Express server concurrently using the aptly named process manager... `concurrently`, some may find this teeth-grinding, others may not care - I see it as a design problem. There is no clear reasoning behind this other than "it works", so in the future I will be looking to change this behaviour to be more suitable, reasonable and hopefully less hacky-feeling.
